            <p>My name is Phinias Nyambita, taking the WDD 130 Module to help me learn how to build
                a
                website. It is so fun to learn new thing as to build a website. The most interesting
                part is that I get to learn different techniques.
                These are necessary especially when I am dealing with images and how the website is
                rendered.
                Hard as it may seem to be, it is, on the other side, a fun activity to learn new
                things
                and
                trying to figure out how to do them. It helps build memory muscles and bring out the
                potential that one has.
                Learning has to be fun even when it appears on the face value as a loft endeavour.

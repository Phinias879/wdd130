            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Mountain View Rafting Company was incorporated in 1991 at Mississippi.
                The company started with a small number of experts dedicated to bring satisfaction
                to
                clients.
                In 2005, the company expanded its operations, covering other areas, providing high
                quality service.
                To date the company has over 45 offices in USA only, and 200 in other parts of the
                world.
                From the time the company started up to now, it has earned more than 50 awards in
                customer service from different institutions, and has been nominated more than 60
                times to be the best rafting company in USA.
                Truly, we can say that we are the best when it comes to adventures in rivers.
